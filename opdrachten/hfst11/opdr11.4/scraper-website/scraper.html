                Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while
                suspended in the atmosphere and then
                fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further
                changes. It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout
                its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the
                ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter
                size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose
                in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away.

                Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and
                nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main
                constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of most
                living organisms. It is vital for all known forms of life,
                even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its
                chemical formula is H2O, meaning that each of its molecules
                contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by
                covalent bonds.

                The Christian cross, seen as a representation of the instrument
                of the crucifixion of Jesus, is the best-known symbol of
                Christianity. It is related to the crucifix (a cross that
                includes a corpus, usually a three-dimensional representation
                of Jesus' body) and to the more general family of cross
                symbols, the term cross itself being detached from the original
                specifically Christian meaning in modern English (as in many
                other western languages)

                The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a
                nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal
                convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo
                process. It is by far the most important source of energy for
                life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers
                , or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is
                about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about
                99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.

                Mountains are large landforms that rises above the surrounding
                land in a limited area, usually in the form of peaks.
                A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are
                formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can
                locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly
                through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers.
                A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge
                mountain ranges.

                In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible
                mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other
                particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or
                similar space. Water or various other chemicals may compose
                the droplets and crystals. On Earth, clouds are formed as a
                result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew
                point, or when it gains sufficient moisture from an adjacent
                source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.

            <p>
            Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data
            scraping used for extracting data from websites.
            Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly
            using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser.
            While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the
            term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a
            bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying, in which specific
            data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a
            central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or
            analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
            Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting
            from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser
            does when you view the page). Therefore, web crawling is a main
            component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing.
            Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a
            page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into
            a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something
            out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere
            else. An example would be to find and copy names and phone
            numbers, or companies and their URLs, to a list
            (contact scraping).
            </p>
            <p>
            Web scraping is used for contact scraping, and as a component
            of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data
            mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison,
            product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering
            real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change
            detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation,
            web mashup and, web data integration.
            </p>
            <p>
            Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages
            (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data
            in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human
            end-users and not for ease of automated use. Because of this,
            tool kits that scrape web content were created. Companies like
            Amazon AWS and Google provide web scraping tools, services and
            public data available free of cost to end users.
            </p>
            <p>
            Newer forms of web scraping involve listening to data feeds from
            web servers. For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport
            storage mechanism between the client and the web server.
            </p>
            <p>
            There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping,
            such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing)
            their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that
            rely on using techniques in DOM parsing, computer vision and
            natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable
            gathering web page content for offline parsing.
